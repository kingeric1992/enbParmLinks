# enbParmLinks
A enbplugin for SkyrimLE enb that provides linkage between enb variables or system values and address.
___

# Installation
Put enbParmLink.enbplugin under `/enbseries` in your SkyrimLE base directory.

# Setup
All linkage is defined through enbParmLink.cfg located in /enbseries, with 3 sections `[INIT]`, `[READ]` and `[SYNC]`.
```ini
;Expression on the right hand side will be assigned to the left hand side.
[READ]
EFFECT.TXT:"target parm" = ENBEFFECT.FX:"source parm"

;Any changes from either sides will sync to the counter part
[SYNC]
ENBDEPTHOFFIELD.FX:"sync fov" = FLOAT:0x01B39A4C

;Values are set upon ENB reset, load or saves.
[INIT] 
; to assign simple value to target
FLOAT:0x01B39A4C = 70
```
To assign a calculated value, use keyword `EXPR:`
```
EFFECT.TXT:"calculated value" = EXPR:" (a0*2 + a1) ", EFFECT.TXT:"val", EFFECT.TXT:"useCalc"
```
where variable are listed after the EXPR expression in sequential order from a0 - a19, separated by commas.

Additionally, multiline expressions and linking to same key is also avalible.
```ini
; linking to same variable
EFFECT.TXT:"VALUE" = EXPR:"conditional(1, (a0 == 0) || ( a0 == 2 ) || (a0 == 4) )", EFFECT.TXT:"raw"
EFFECT.TXT:"VALUE" = EXPR:"conditional(2, (a0 == 0x01) || ( a0 == 0x03 ) || (a0 == 0x05) )", EFFECT.TXT:"raw"

; multi-line are enclosed by <<<LINES & LINES pairs
EFFECT.TXT:"focal length" = <<<LINES
    EXPR:" conditional( 18 /tan(_pi/360 * a0), a0 && (a1 == 0) ) ", 
    FLOAT:0x01B39A4C , EFFECT.TXT:"calc fov"
LINES
```

# Syntax
## Read-Only expressions:
___
### `SYSTEM:<SYSVALS>`

+ SYSVALS

   avaliable values:
   + ENBVERSION
   
      ENB binary version.
   + MOUSE_X
   + MOUSE_Y

      Cursor position on XY coordinate in pixels relative to upper left corner of game window.
   + KEY_HOLD_*
   + KEY_PRESS_*
   + KEY_TOGGLE_*

      Keyboard input states. Replace asterisks with VK keycode of target key.


### `EXPR:<EXPR_STRING>, <EXPRESSION>,...`
+ EXPR_STRING

   Arithmetic expression enclosed by "".
+ EXPRESSION

   A expresion linked to the variables denoted by a0, a1... in the EXPR_STRING. 
   Seperate multiple expressions by "," when more then one variables are used.
   
Remarks:

   Numeric operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`, `%`
   
   Logical operators: `&&`, `||`, `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `? :`*(ternary operator)*
   
   Intrinsic functions: `sin()`, `cos()`, `tan()`, `atan2(x,y)`, `asin()`, `acos()`, `atan()`, `sinh()`, `cosh()`, `tanh()`, `asinh()`, `acosh()`, `atanh()`, `log2()`, `log10()`, `ln()`, `exp()`, `sign()`, `rint()`*(round)*, `min(x,y)`, `max(x,y)`, `clamp(x, min, max)`, `lerp(x,y,w)`
   Special functions: 
   * `conditional( value, cond)`
      
      Only sets the value when the condition is true.
   
### `<CONSTANT>`
+ CONSTANT

   Numeric Constant. example usage `FLOAT:0x01B39A4C = 70`


## Read-Writes expressions:
___
`<SECTION_NAME>:<ENBPARM_UINAME>`
+ SECTION_NAME

   Section names listed by enb UI. For example, ENBBLOOM.FX, COLORCORRECTION, .etc
+ ENBPARAM_UINAME

   Parameter name listed in .fx parm annotation UIName, or name listed in enbUI.
+ example: `ENFEFFECT.FX:"my Awsome Variable"`
 
`<TYPE>:<ADDRESS>+<OFFSET>+...`
+ TYPE

   Variable type of this address. Possible values are `INT`, `FLOAT`, `BOOL`.
+ ADDRESS

   The memory address of the variable.
+ OFFSET

   The memory offsets to apply if base address need to be dereferenced. 
+ example: `FLOAT:0x012E56A0+0x20`
